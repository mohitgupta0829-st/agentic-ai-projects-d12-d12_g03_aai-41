Autonomous Retail Researcher Agent
Overview

    The Autonomous Retail Researcher Agent is an AI-powered system built using Agentic AI and multi-agent architecture to automate retail research tasks.

    It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), CrewAI, and LangChain to collect, analyze, and summarize real-time retail data from multiple online sources — eliminating the need for manual research.

Problem Statement

    Retail research involves:

      Monitoring market trends
      Analyzing competitors
      Studying product demand
      Gathering insights from multiple sources

 Objectives

    Build an autonomous research system
    Implement multi-agent collaboration using CrewAI
    Automate data collection, analysis, and reporting
    Enable natural language query processing
    Store results in a knowledge repository
    Improve research speed and decision-making

Key Features

    Autonomous retail research agent
    Multi-agent system (CrewAI)
    Real-time web data retrieval
    Natural language query interface
    Automated report generation
    LLM-based summarization
    Persistent knowledge storage
    Scalable and modular architecture
    System Architecture
    
    User Query → Main Agent → Research Agent → Analysis Agent
          → Summary Agent → Storage Agent → Final Output

Workflow

    User submits query
    Main agent assigns tasks
    Research agent fetches web data
    Analysis agent filters information
    Summary agent generates insights using LLM
    Storage agent saves report

 The workflow diagram on page 7 visually shows this multi-agent pipeline and how agents collaborate step-by-step.
